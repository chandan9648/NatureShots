💡 How It Works
NatureShot uses:

React Router for navigation between pages (Home, Blog Details, Create Post)

Redux Toolkit for managing blog data (create, edit, delete, like, comment)

React Quill for a rich text editor experience

Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design

Currently, all blog data is stored locally (frontend-only).
Future updates may include backend integration with Node.js + MongoDB for persistent storage.
